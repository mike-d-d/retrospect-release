/**
 * A Link is a directed connection between two Blocks (the Link's {@link #origin}, which is fixed,
 * and its {@link #target}, which can be changed). During construction of the block graph a Link's
 * target may be set to a FutureBlock, which serves as a placeholder until the target block is
 * available.
 *
 * <p>Each block has a small, fixed number of outlinks (0, 1, or 2), but may have an unbounded
 * number of inlinks. The Block (or FutureBlock) has an {@link LinkTarget#inLink} field pointing to
 * one of the inlinks; in order to find the others, all Links with the same target are connected in
 * a circular list via their {@link #sibling} field.
 *
 * <p>Each Link has an {@link #info} field used to save what that is known about the register state
 * when the executing code crosses that link (i.e. when it has completed the link's source block,
 * before beginning its target block).
