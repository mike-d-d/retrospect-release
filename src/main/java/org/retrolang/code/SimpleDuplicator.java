/**
 * A static-only class that implements the "duplicate simple blocks to enable skipping a test"
 * optimization.
 *
 * <p>{@link TestBlock#runForwardProp} already implements an optimization that checks each inlink to
 * see if it has enough information to enable skipping the test. For example, given the blocks
 * created by code like
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if someTest() {
 *   true1()
 *   nextTest = true
 * } else {
 *   false1()
 *   nextTest = false
 * }
 * if nextTest {
 *   true2()
 * } else {
 *   false2()
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * the TestBlock optimization would transform the block graph to the equivalent of
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if someTest() {
 *   true1()
 *   nextTest = true
 *   true2()
 * } else {
 *   false1()
 *   nextTest = false
 *   false2()
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * (and if {@code nextTest} were otherwise unused would drop those assignments as well).
 *
 * <p>This class extends that optimization to apply in some cases where there are intervening
 * assignments, e.g. transforming
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if someTest() {
 *   true1()
 *   nextTest = true
 * } else {
 *   false1()
 *   nextTest = false
 * }
 * someVar1 = someVar2
 * someVar3 = 42
 * if nextTest {
 *   true2()
 * } else {
 *   false2()
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * into
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if someTest() {
 *   true1()
 *   nextTest = true
 *   someVar1 = someVar2
 *   someVar3 = 42
 *   true2()
 * } else {
 *   false1()
 *   nextTest = false
 *   someVar1 = someVar2
 *   someVar3 = 42
 *   false2()
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Note that this required duplicating two blocks (the assignments to {@code someVar1} and {@code
 * someVar3}); to avoid having our optimizations increase the complexity of the code we only
 * consider applying it when the blocks that would have to be duplicated are sufficiently simple
 * (e.g. a register copy or setting a register to a constant).
 *
 * <p>In addition to simple assignments, the other type of block considered simple is a {@link
 * BackRef}. This enables us to optimize some common while-loop patterns, e.g.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   done = 0
 * loopStart:
 *   if done != 0 { goto loopDone }
 *   loopBody()
 *   if exitCondition() {
 *     done = 1
 *   }
 *   goBack loopStart
 * loopDone:
 * }</pre>
 *
 * can skip the test by duplicating the BackRef:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   done = 0
 * loopStart:
 *   if done != 0 {
 * isDone:
 *     goto loopDone
 *   }
 *   loopBody()
 *   if exitCondition() {
 *     done = 1
 *     goBack isDone
 *   }
 *   goBack loopStart
 * loopDone:
 * }</pre>
 *
 * which after other optimizations can just be
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * loopStart:
 *   loopBody()
 *   if not exitCondition() {
 *     goBack loopStart
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>There are two points where we check for whether this optimization is applicable:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>After a TestBlock is added to the block graph, we call {@link #checkTestInlinks} to look
 *       backward through the test's inlinks.
 *   <li>When we encounter a simple block with multiple inlinks during forward propagation, we call
 *       {@link #lookAheadForTestBlock} to see if there is an upcoming test that one or more of
 *       those inlinks could skip.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>While the duplicates created by the first application of this optimization are necessary (they
 * have different outlinks -- one before the TestBlock, the other after), repeated application of
 * this and/or other optimizations may result in duplicates that have the same outlink and hence are
 * completely redundant. We address this by periodically checking for this situation and calling
 * {@link CodeBuilder#mergeMatching} to clean it up.
