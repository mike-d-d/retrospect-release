     *
     * ... and indeed, it's pretty easy to do so by just keeping a register copy if it's identical

     *
     * <p>There are many less obvious cases where we would also like to preserve the information
     * that two registers are the same; for example
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:intRange(0, 2), r2:r1 }  union  { r1:r2, r2:intRange(1, 5) }
     * </pre>
     *
     * should also be
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:intRange(0, 5), r2:r1 }
     * </pre>
     *
     * or (equivalently)
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:r2, r2:intRange(0, 5) }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Another less-obvious case:
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:intRange(0, 2), r2:r1, r3:r1 } union { r1:intRange(1, 5), r2:intRange(1, 5), r3:r2 }
     * </pre>
     *
     * should be
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:intRange(0, 5), r2:intRange(0, 5), r3:r2 }
     * </pre>
     *
     * (or the equivalent version with {@code r2:r3} and {@code r3:intRange(0, 5)} — but I'll stop
     * listing the equivalent variants). Although the first branch didn't explicitly say that r3 was
     * a copy of r2, that follows from them both being copies of r1. Note that even though r1 and r2
     * have the same range of possible values, in the second branch there is no evidence that they
     * are equal so the union must assume that they might not be.
     *
     * <p>Somewhat similar:
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:intRange(0, 2), r2:r1 }  union  { r1:3, r2:3 }
     * </pre>
     *
     * should be
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:intRange(0, 3), r2:r1 }
     * </pre>
     *
     * Again, the second branch doesn't explicitly say that r1 is a copy of r2, but if they both
     * have the same constant value (in this case, 3) it follows that they're equal.
     *
     * <p>One last pattern we want to catch:
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:3, r2:3 }  union  { r1:4, r2:4 }
     * </pre>
     *
     * should be
     *
     * <pre>
     *    { r1:intRange(3, 4), r2:r1 }
     * </pre>
     *
     * In this case (which only occurs when a pair of registers gets assigned the same simple value
     * in each branch) we introduce a register copy where there was none before.
