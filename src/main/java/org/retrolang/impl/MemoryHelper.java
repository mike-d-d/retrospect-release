/**
 * A MemoryHelper handles memory allocation and deallocation for a single thread; MemoryHelpers are
 * not thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>Before use a MemoryHelper must be bound to a ResourceTracker; allocations and deallocations
 * will update that tracker's totals.
 *
 * <p>When bound to a non-debug ResourceTracker, MemoryHelper does not notify the ResourceTracker
 * separately of each allocation and release; instead it aggregates the quantities and updates the
 * ResourceTracker only on calls to {@link #reserve} or {@link #checkAvailable}, or when the
 * ResourceTracker is unbound. When bound to a debug ResourceTracker each allocation and
 * deallocation is passed through immediately.
 *
 * <p>The Allocator implementation also includes a very small optimization: the last-released byte[]
 * and Object[] are saved, and if the next allocation needs an array of the same size the released
 * one is re-used. This is just a placeholder for additional optimizations to be added in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>MemoryHelper's {@link #reserve} method is similar to {@link #checkAvailable}, except that if
 * it succeeds the specified amount of memory has been set aside and cannot be claimed by other
 * threads sharing the ResourceTracker. Subsequent calls to {@link #allocByteArray}, {@link
 * #allocObjectArray}, or {@link #recordAlloc} will automatically use the reserved memory until it
 * has been exhausted, after which it reverts to claiming additional memory from the ResourceTracker
 * as needed.
