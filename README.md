# Retrospect

Retrospect is a programming langauge designed for scalable data analysis.
It is designed to support simple, high-level descriptions of large-scale
data analyses, like SQL, but provide the expressiveness of lower-level
frameworks like Beam and Spark.

This project is under development.  It is not yet a useful tool for data
analysis.

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is not
