 *   <li>active (currently being executed by a Java thread, with associated TState),
 *   <li>suspended (waiting for some asynchronous event),
 *   <li>completed (returned a result, encountered an error, or cancelled because its result is no
 *       longer needed).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Active and suspended RThreads have an associated Waiter that will be notified when the thread
 * completes. The Waiter usually has the only counted reference to the RThread; if the RThread's
 * refCount goes to zero it assumes that the Waiter is no longer interested and that any in-progress
 * computation should be cancelled. Note that in this case there is a race condition between the
 * notification being delivered and the RThread being dropped, so the Waiter must be prepared to
 * receive a notification even after its refCount has gone to zero.
