/**
 * Assigns a Java local index to each register. We could just assign distinct indices to each
 * register, but I assume that using fewer indices will reduce the JVM resources required to run the
 * code.
 *
 * <p>If two registers are assigned the same index I refer to them as "aliased".
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If registers r1 and r2 are live at the same time and may have different values, they must
 *       not be aliased (since storing one would modify the other).
 *   <li>On the other hand, if there are simple SetBlocks "r1 = r2" and it is valid to alias r1 and
 *       r2, doing so will allow us to optimize away those blocks (they would be setting a Java
 *       local to itself).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>We choose the assignment in two stages:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Identify maximal sets of registers that we can alias, where each member of the set is
 *       assigned to another member of the set at least once (this is done by the constructor).
 *   <li>Assign a Java local index to each alias set, ensuring no two alias sets get the same local
 *       index unless they're never live at the same time (this is done by {@link
 *       #assignJavaLocalNumbers}).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Aliasing introduced by the first stage enables us to drop some SetBlocks; aliasing introduced
 * by the second stage doesn't reduce the code size but may enable the JVM to run it more
 * efficiently (by minimizing the size of its local variable array).
 *
 * <p>To find a relatively optimal partition in the first stage we first do a pass through the
 * blocks constructing two two-dimensional bitmaps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code registerConflicts[r1,r2]}: if {@code registerConflicts[r1,r2]} is true or {@code
 *       registerConflicts[r2,r1]} is true, r1 and r2 must not be aliases
 *   <li>{@code preferAlias[r1,r2]}: if {@code preferAlias[r1,r2]}is true, aliasing r1 and r2 would
 *       enable us to delete at least one SetBlock
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>(Since we don't have a two-dimensional bitmap type we actually use a {@code Bits.Builder[]}.)
 *
 * <p>We then consider each register {@code r} in sequence, and expand {@code r} to a maximal set of
 * registers that are transitively connected in {@code preferAlias} and no two of which are directly
 * connected in {@code registerConflicts}.
 *
 * <p>For the second stage we choose the smallest local index that has not already been assigned to
 * any register that conflicts with any in the alias set.
